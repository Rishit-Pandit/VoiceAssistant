# Voice Assistant
### About the model
This is a project in which we create a voice assistant which will get our commands through the help of the <b>SpeechRecognition</b> library and responds back to us in the voice of Microsoft David by using the <b>pyttsx3</b> libray. This model reponds to us only when we specify the action. We have 18 actions in total till now and we will increase then in future versions.
### How to make the model
To make the model first we have to install the following packages:pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, wikipedia. These can be installed by the following commands: `pip install pyttsx3`, `pip install SpeechRecognition`, `pip install wikipedia` Then run the python file that is given in the reponsitory.
